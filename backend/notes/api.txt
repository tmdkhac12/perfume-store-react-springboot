- Request convention:
    + Use camelCase for payloads key
    + Filter, sort, paginate using query params: 'GET /appointments?status=confirmed&sort=date&limit=10&page=2'
    + Get requests always send data using query params
    + If 'get all' does not find any records, return an empty list

- PUT for a whole object, PATCH for partial object

- ResponseEntity is a class that gives you the role to customize a response instead of returning an object
with 200 status, you can customize both headers and body via its built-in methods
    + Declare syntax: ResponseEntity<Body_Object>
