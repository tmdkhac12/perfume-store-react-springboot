- When using MySQL, the internal docker container port must be xxxx:3306 (this is hardcoded)
- Docker scripts init do not allow '#' comments, must remove all

- If you don't specify a volume to store data, when you run 'docker compose up' it will create an anonymous
volume to store your data temporarily and the volume will vanish when you run 'docker compose down' not when
you turn the container on/off
- A volume can store data regardless you deleted the container and the image, it will only vanish when you
delete it manually or when you run 'docker compose down -v'

- Tables name convention:
    + Table name should be singular (user, brand)
    + Using snake_case lowercase for table name & fields name  (invoice_details, created_at)
